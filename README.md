##  Introduction
This project explores emotion classification from text using three different deep learning models:
- Fully Connected Neural Network (FCNN)
- LSTM (with Bidirectional LSTM layer)
- Transformer-based model (BERT from HuggingFace)

The task is to classify input sentences into six emotion categories: *anger, fear, joy, love, sadness, surprise*. The models are trained and evaluated on a clean emotion-labelled dataset.
